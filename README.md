# random-path-generator

This uses **Turtle** to generate a random path

The libraries used are ```turtle```, ```time``` and ```random```

It's actually quite a simple program, but unpredictable because all decisions and changes that take place are randomized

The  ```time``` library and it's ```time.sleep()``` function is used because the turtle window is very quick to open and start working and it's a bit difficult to see what's happening

You have to input the number of times you want the random path should be drawn (i.e., number of loops)
